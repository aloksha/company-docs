# FAQ

## My company has purchased the license(s). Why do I see no license info in my account? 

You are not the one who purchased the license and your email address is not one of the order contacts. Please follow the steps on [How do I invite other contact to access the Dynamsoft license I purchased?](#how-do-i-invite-other-contacts-to-access-the-dynamsoft-license-i-purchased)

If you are one of the order contacts, but you still cannot see the license detail of this order, please contact us <support@dynamsoft.com>. 

	
## How do I invite other contact(s) to access the Dynamsoft license I purchased?

Once you purchased a license, your developer may want to get the license from the portal directly.

Step 1: Check if the contact you want to add is one user under your company.

Please go to "Account Setting" - "Profile" and click "More Details" under "Company Info".

You will find "User List" of your company and search if the person is listed or not.

Step 2: 

- Case 1: If the person is listed on "User List", please go to "Order" - "My Order" and find the specified order. There is a button "Contact" on "Operations" column. Please click it and add the contact email address and specify "Contact Type". Then the new contact of this order can check the order detail and its license detail.

- Case 2: If the person is not the one under your company, please invite it first. Please go to "Account Setting" - "Contacts", fill in the email address and choose the specified company, then click "Invite".

The person who is invited will receive an Invite Confirm Email. Once he/she confirms, he/she will be listed on "User List", then repeat the process in Case 1.
