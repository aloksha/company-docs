# Request Upgrade 

## Check Maintenance Status to Determine if Upgrade is Free

If the maintenance of your license(s) is valid, you can request to upgrade it for free. Otherwise, you need to pay for the upgrade.

You can check the maintenance of your license(s) in **[Customer Portal - License - Full License](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/fullLicense)**. "Usage/Service Expiry Date" for each license means the license or maintenance expiry date.

## Request for a free upgrade of the license(s)

If you want to upgrade your license from the old version to the newer version, you can click "Upgrade" button under "Manage", or contact us via email <sales@dynamsoft.com>.
